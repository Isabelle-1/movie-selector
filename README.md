# movie-selector
The purpose for my APP
    What my app will do
-My movie-selector app was created in order to reduce the infinant number of movie choices available, by sorting them accord into the users mood.
    The business problem
-Often I find myself in a situation where I cant find the right movie to watch, especially in group situations, as a result, I decided to use the (collective) users mood to determine a limited number of options, decreasing the time it takes to choose a movie.
    The target audience
-My app will be able to reach a large demographic, as it targets anyone interested in watching movies reguardless of gender, age, race, income etc.

List of features that will be included in the app
-Conditional/control flow statments (if/else)
-Loops
-Classes
-Methods
-Variables
-Input/Output
-Error handling
